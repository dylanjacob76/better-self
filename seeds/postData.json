You can also do the 20% of tasks and outsource the other 80%. Chances are your competition is trying to do a mix of both so you can absolutely obliterate them."

(Visualize someone coming into your room when you're trying to focus and how you would deal with it. Visualize getting sucked into YouTube and wasting 3 hours watching pointless videos. Now mentally rehearse how you would overcome that)."
